# Super-Agrus
Open Source Logging tool

> **Want something to watch?** `testapp/` is a small gin + GORM service that ships its logs to Argus, with a traffic generator and a ready-made dashboard. See [testapp/README.md](testapp/README.md).

## Running

```
cp .env.example .env   # set ARGUS_JWT_SECRET (and ARGUS_ADMIN_EMAIL / ARGUS_ADMIN_PASSWORD for first boot)
go run ./cmd/argus
```

`.env` is picked up from the working directory or any parent. Real environment variables win over `.env`.

### Postgres instead of SQLite

Set `ARGUS_DB_DSN=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=disable` to use Postgres for metadata and the chunk index instead of the default SQLite file. Migrations and GORM model behavior are validated in CI against Postgres 16 (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `postgres` job and `internal/db/db_test.go`'s `TestOpenAndMigrate_Postgres`); `docker-compose up -d postgres` gives the same thing locally. `argus backup` does not support Postgres — use `pg_dump` instead.

## Local dev environment (Nix)

`flake.nix` provides two dev shells and a one-command local environment:

```
nix develop                 # Go + Node 22 + process-compose, for running pieces by hand
nix develop .#testapp       # Go only, for working on testapp in isolation
nix run .#dev-env           # builds the web client, then runs everything via process-compose
```

`nix run .#dev-env` builds the Expo web client (`cd app && npm ci && npm run build:web`, skipped if `internal/webui/dist/index.html` already exists; force a rebuild with `ARGUS_REBUILD_CLIENT=1`), then starts `process-compose up --no-server`, which runs Argus (readiness-probed on `/healthz`), mints a testapp API key against the real auth/API-key endpoints (`scripts/dev/mint-key.sh`, writes `testapp/.env.generated`), starts testapp wired to that key, and leaves an optional traffic generator disabled by default (toggle it from the process-compose TUI).

With [direnv](https://direnv.net/) installed, `.envrc` (and `testapp/.envrc`) run `use flake` automatically on `cd`.

Not covered by this setup: the Expo native dev loop (`npx expo start`, for iOS/Android) is still run by hand from `app/`; database migrations aren't orchestrated separately, since `go run ./cmd/argus` applies them on boot.

## Ingest (Phase 2)

`POST /api/v1/ingest/push` with header `X-Argus-Key: <api key>` (mint one via `POST /api/v1/api-keys` as admin).
Body is NDJSON, optionally gzip (`Content-Encoding: gzip`), max 5 MB:

```
{"ts":"2026-03-01T12:00:00Z","labels":{"service":"api","env":"prod"},"line":"GET /x 200"}
```

- `ts` is RFC3339 or epoch nanoseconds; if omitted the server time is used. Older than 24h or more than 5 min ahead is rejected.
- Default labels for the batch can be set with `X-Argus-Labels: service=api,env=prod`; per-line labels override them.
- Response: `{"accepted":N,"rejected":M,"errors":[...]}`. `200` when anything was accepted, `400` when everything was rejected, `429` (with `Retry-After`) when the key's rate limit is hit, `413` for oversized bodies/batches.

**Do not put user IDs, request IDs or session IDs in labels.** Every distinct label set is a stream, and each API key may hold at most `ARGUS_MAX_STREAMS_PER_KEY` (default 10,000) of them. Put high-cardinality values in the log line instead.

### Restricting an API key's labels

An API key's `allowed_labels` (set at creation, `POST /api-keys`) restricts the values it may write for the label keys it names: `{"service": "checkout"}` allows only `service=checkout`; `{"service": ["checkout", "billing"]}` allows either. A label key not named in `allowed_labels` passes through unrestricted — this only locks down the keys an operator chooses to name, not the whole label set — and an empty or absent `allowed_labels` (the default for every key today) is unrestricted, same as before this existed. A push using a disallowed value is rejected the same way a too-long value is.

This restricts what a key can **write**, not what a logged-in user can **read**: there is no query-time tenant isolation yet, so any authenticated user can still query across every stream regardless of which key ingested it. Treat `allowed_labels` as a guard against a misconfigured shipper, not as multi-tenant data isolation.

### Limits
15 labels per stream, 256 bytes per label value, 64 KB per line (longer lines are truncated with a `...[truncated]` marker), per-key rate limits `ARGUS_RATE_LINES_PER_SEC` (default 10,000; a key's own `rate_limit` overrides it) and `ARGUS_RATE_BYTES_PER_SEC` (default 10 MB), with bursts up to 5x.

### Storage layout and durability
```
data/argus.db                                   SQLite metadata: users, keys, streams, chunk index
data/wal/wal-XXXXXXXX.log                       write-ahead log segments
data/chunks/yyyy/mm/dd/<stream_id>/<id>.chk     zstd-compressed chunk files
```
Every accepted line is appended to the WAL before the request is acknowledged. The WAL is fsynced every `ARGUS_WAL_SYNC_MS` (default 200; `0` = fsync on every request). After a crash (`kill -9`, power loss) at most that window of acknowledged lines can be lost; the rest is replayed into chunk files on the next start. A crash right after chunks were written but before old WAL segments were dropped can duplicate lines on replay (at-least-once).

Head chunks flush to disk at ~1 MB or ~1 h of age, and on graceful shutdown. Chunks older than `ARGUS_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 14) are deleted hourly, along with streams that have no chunks left.

### Chunk storage backend

Chunks are stored on local disk by default (`ARGUS_CHUNK_STORE=local`, the layout above). Set `ARGUS_CHUNK_STORE=s3` to store them in an S3-compatible bucket instead: `ARGUS_S3_BUCKET` (required), plus optional `ARGUS_S3_REGION`, `ARGUS_S3_ENDPOINT` (point this at MinIO or another S3-compatible service; it enables path-style addressing), and `ARGUS_S3_PREFIX`. Credentials come from the standard AWS chain (env vars, shared config/credentials files, or an IAM role) — there is no Argus-specific credential setting. The WAL and SQLite index always stay on local disk; only chunk files move.

**Backup with `ARGUS_CHUNK_STORE=s3`:** `argus backup` only copies the WAL and the SQLite index in this mode — there is no local chunk tree to walk, and S3's own durability is the substitute for the chunk-copy step. The backup log line says so explicitly (`chunks_not_copied_reason` / a `WARN` instead of an `INFO` on completion).

### Load testing
```
ARGUS_LOAD_SECONDS=600 ARGUS_LOAD_RATE=2000 go test ./internal/ingest -run TestLoad -timeout 20m -v
```

## Querying (Phase 3)

All query routes need `Authorization: Bearer <access token>` (any role).

- `GET /api/v1/query/range?query=&start=&end=&limit=&direction=`
  - `start` (inclusive) and `end` (exclusive) are required: RFC3339 or unix nanoseconds.
  - `direction` is `backward` (newest first, default) or `forward`. `limit` defaults to 1,000 and is capped at 5,000.
  - Returns `{"entries":[{"ts","stream","line","fields"}],"streams":{id:{labels}},"stats":{...}}`. `ts` and stream ids are strings because they exceed JavaScript's safe integer range. `fields` is present when the query has a `| json` or `| logfmt` stage.
- `GET /api/v1/labels` and `GET /api/v1/labels/{name}/values` (optional `start`/`end`) feed autocomplete.

### ArgusQL
```
{service="api", env=~"prod|staging"} |= "timeout" != "healthcheck" | json | level="error" | status>=500
```
- Selector matchers: `=` `!=` `=~` `!~`. At least one must not match an empty value (`{service=~".*"}` is rejected). Regexes are RE2 and anchored.
- Line filters: `|=` contains, `!=` does not contain, `|~` regex, `!~` negated regex.
- Parsers: `| json` (nested keys are joined with `_`, so `req.id` becomes `req_id`) and `| logfmt`.
- Field filters after a parser (or on stream labels): `=` `!=` `=~` `!~` against strings or numbers, and `>` `>=` `<` `<=` against numbers. A missing field behaves like `""`; numeric comparisons on missing or non-numeric fields never match.
- In double-quoted strings write `"\\d+"` to get a backslash, or use a backtick string: `` `\d+` ``.
- Metric queries (`count_over_time`, `sum by`, `topk`) arrive in Phase 6.

### Query limits
Required time range; at most `ARGUS_QUERY_MAX_RANGE` (default `168h`); `ARGUS_QUERY_TIMEOUT` (default `30s`); at most `ARGUS_QUERY_MAX_BYTES_MB` (default 4096) of raw log data scanned; `ARGUS_QUERY_CONCURRENCY` (default 4) simultaneous queries per user. Errors: `400 bad_query`, `422 query_limit`, `429 too_many_queries`, `504 query_timeout`.

### How a query runs
Streams are found through the indexed `stream_labels` table, then chunks overlapping the range are selected from the `chunks` table. Chunk files are scanned in parallel (one worker per CPU), skipping blocks outside the range, and merged with the not-yet-flushed head chunks. Results are bounded top-N, and in `backward` mode chunks are visited newest-first and skipped once they cannot improve a full result. Results are totally ordered (time, stream, line), so they are deterministic.

On a 12-core dev machine with 10M lines (1.25 GB raw, 100 streams, 1,000 chunks) and a 1h window: selector plus `|=` answers in 40-70 ms; a worst-case full scan of every line (`|= "no-such-text"` across all streams) takes ~0.6 s. Reproduce with `ARGUS_QUERY_LINES=10000000 go test ./internal/query -run LargeDataset -v`.

Golden files live in `internal/query/testdata`; refresh them with `go test ./internal/query -update` and review the diff.

## Client app (Phase 4)

`app/` is one Expo (React Native) codebase for iOS, Android and web: Expo Router, TypeScript, TanStack Query, Zustand, FlashList. Screens so far: sign-in, Explore (label browser, ArgusQL input with label and value autocomplete, time range picker, virtualized results with expandable lines and JSON pretty-printing) and Settings. Dark and light themes follow the system.

```
cd app
npm install
npm run web          # dev server in the browser
npm run ios          # or: npm run android (needs a simulator/emulator or Expo Go)
npm test             # Jest + React Native Testing Library
npm run typecheck
```

**Pointing the app at a server.** On iOS and Android the sign-in screen asks for the server address and remembers it. The web build served by Argus itself uses the same origin. For `npm run web` against a server on another port, create `app/.env.local` with `EXPO_PUBLIC_ARGUS_URL=http://localhost:8080` and start Argus with `ARGUS_CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8081`.

**Sessions.** Native apps keep the refresh token in the OS keystore (`expo-secure-store`). The web client never touches a refresh token from JavaScript: the server sets it as an HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookie (`Secure` behind HTTPS), and access tokens live only in memory.

**Typed API client.** The server publishes its OpenAPI document at `/api/v1/openapi.yaml` (source: `internal/api/openapi/openapi.yaml`). A Go test fails if the router and the document disagree. Regenerate the TypeScript types with `npm run gen:api` after changing it. We write the spec first and verify it against the router rather than using `oapi-codegen` or `swaggo`; this avoids restructuring the handlers or annotating them, and the parity test keeps it honest.

**Embedding the web UI in the binary.**
```
cd app && npm run build:web     # exports into internal/webui/dist
cd .. && go build ./cmd/argus   # the binary now serves the UI at /
```
Without the build step the binary still compiles and `/` explains how to build the UI. `dist/` is git-ignored.

## Live tail (Phase 5)

`GET /api/v1/tail?query=...` streams matching lines as they are ingested, as server-sent events. It takes the same ArgusQL as `/query/range` (a stream selector is required; line filters, `| json` / `| logfmt` and field filters all work) but no time range. Send the access token as `Authorization: Bearer ...` (browsers' `EventSource` cannot, so clients use `fetch` streaming).

Events: `ready`, `entry` (`{ts, stream, labels, line, fields}`), `dropped` (`{"count":N}`), `expired`. Lines starting with `:` are 15-second heartbeats.

- **Filtering is server-side**, so a narrow query costs the client nothing for lines it does not match.
- **A slow client never slows ingest.** Each tail has a bounded buffer; when it is full, batches are dropped for that tail only and the client is told with a `dropped` event (the app shows "N lines were skipped"). A client that stops reading entirely is disconnected after a 10 s write timeout.
- **Caps:** `ARGUS_TAIL_PER_USER` (default 5) and `ARGUS_TAIL_MAX` (default 500) open tails; over the cap returns `429`.
- **Token lifetime:** a tail ends with an `expired` event when the access token expires. The app refreshes the token and reconnects on its own.
- **Measured:** a pushed line reaches the Go test client in under 10 ms, and a Chrome tab running the web app shows it in about 90-100 ms (it renders in 100 ms batches). Ingesting 16,000 lines with a stalled tail attached took 0.9 s.

In the app, the **Live Tail** tab has start/stop, pause/resume (new lines are held and counted while paused), auto-scroll, clear, level coloring, and keeps the newest 2,000 lines in memory. It reconnects with exponential backoff if the connection drops.

SSE is the only transport. If it proves unreliable on a particular mobile network or proxy, a WebSocket endpoint is the planned fallback (not built).

## Metric queries and dashboards (Phase 6)

### Metric queries
`GET /api/v1/query/metric?query=&start=&end=&step=` evaluates a range aggregation at every step:

```
count_over_time({service="api"} |= "error" [5m])
rate({env="prod"} | json | status>=500 [1m])
bytes_over_time({service="api"}[1h])
sum by (level) (count_over_time({env="prod"} | json [1m]))
topk(10, sum by (route) (count_over_time({service="api"} | json | status>=500 [1h])))
```

- The value at time *t* covers the lines in `(t - window, t]`. `rate` is lines per second; `bytes_over_time` sums line sizes.
- Without `sum`, there is one series per stream (labelled with the stream labels). `sum by (a, b)` groups by those labels; they may be stream labels or fields extracted by `| json` / `| logfmt`. `sum(...)` alone folds everything into one series.
- `topk(n, ...)` keeps the n largest series **at each step**, so a series can appear and disappear (the chart breaks the line there).
- `step` is a duration (`30s`, `5m`) or seconds; by default about 250 points. `start` and `end` are aligned down to the step, and **identical requests are cached for one step**, so dashboards refreshing faster than their step do not rescan.
- Durations accept `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `w`.
- Response: `{"series":[{"labels":{},"values":[[unix_ms, value],...]}],"start_ms","end_ms","step_ms","stats"}`.
- Limits: `ARGUS_QUERY_METRIC_MAX_RANGE` (default `744h`), at most 2,000 steps and 500 series per query, plus the scan-bytes budget, timeout and per-user concurrency from the log query limits. Over a limit returns `422`.

### Dashboards, panels, saved queries
REST resources under `/api/v1` (viewers read, editors and admins write): `/dashboards`, `/dashboards/{id}` (includes panels), `/dashboards/{id}/panels[/{panelId}]`, `/saved-queries`. A panel has a `type` (`timeseries`, `top_n`, `stat`, `logs`), a `query` (metric for the first three, log for `logs`; validated on save), an optional `step`, free-form `options` (the app uses `width` and `height`) and a `position`. A dashboard holds up to 100 panels.

### In the app
- **Dashboards tab:** list, create, open. A dashboard has one time range and one auto-refresh interval (off, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m) shared by every panel, in a single row above the panels. Charts keep their previous frame (dimmed) while refreshing.
- **Panels:** time series (line per series, 2 px lines, hairline grid, legend for 2+ series, crosshair tooltip that lists every series, **Table** toggle with every value, more than 8 series fold into "Other"), top-N ranked bars (newest value, largest first, one hue), stat (headline number plus sparkline) and logs (newest 50 lines).
- **Edit mode** (editors and admins): add, edit and delete panels; move up/down; toggle half/full width; cycle height. We use buttons instead of drag-to-resize, which works the same on touch and mouse.
- **Explore:** *Save query*, *Add to dashboard*, and a row of saved queries to load.
- Chart colors are the validated reference palette from the dataviz guidance (fixed slot order, a series keeps its color when others appear or disappear). `node validate_palette.js` passes for both modes; light-mode contrast is low for three hues, which the legend and table view cover.

Seed data for a demo: push an hour of traffic, then open the Dashboards tab.

## Alerts (Phase 7)

An alert rule runs a **metric query** on a schedule and compares its latest value to a threshold.

- **Rule fields:** `query` (metric query, e.g. `sum(count_over_time({service="api"} |= "error" [5m]))`), `comparator` (`gt|gte|lt|lte|eq`), `threshold`, `window` (evaluation lookback, 15s to 1h, default 5m), `for_duration` (breach must persist this long, up to 24h), `cooldown` (minimum gap between firing notifications, up to 7d), `severity` (`info|warning|critical`), `enabled`, `notify_channel_ids`.
- **Evaluation:** one ruler goroutine ticks every 15s. For each series it takes the newest point; a breaching series decides the value. No data reads as `0`, so "fewer than N lines" rules fire when logs stop. Evaluation errors (for example a limit) keep the current state and show in `last_error`.
- **State machine:** `ok -> pending -> firing -> ok`. With `for_duration` of `0s` a breach fires immediately. A pending rule that recovers returns to `ok` silently. State is stored in `alert_states`, so a restart does not re-fire.
- **Notifications:** sent on `firing` and on `resolved` (only if the firing was notified). A firing inside the `cooldown` window of the last notification is recorded but not sent, and its resolve is not sent either. Every transition (`pending`, `firing`, `resolved`) is stored in `alert_events` with the value and whether delivery succeeded.
- **Channel types:** `webhook`, `email` (SMTP), and `sms` (Twilio's Messages REST API). All three implement the same `notify.Notifier` interface and are dispatched by a `notify.Router` keyed on the channel's `type`; a channel's `type` can't be changed into a different shape without redoing its config (a type change starts from a blank config rather than reinterpreting the old fields).
  - **webhook:** `{url, secret}`. JSON body `{status, rule_id, rule_name, severity, query, comparator, threshold, value, at}` where `status` is `firing`, `resolved` or `test`. If the channel has a secret, the body is signed: `X-Argus-Signature: sha256=<hex HMAC-SHA256>`.
  - **email:** `{smtp_host, smtp_port, username, secret (SMTP password), from, to}`, sent via `net/smtp` (STARTTLS is used automatically when the server advertises it; no separate flag). SMTP's retry convention is the inverse of HTTP's: a `4xx` reply (transient) is retried, a `5xx` reply (permanent) is not.
  - **sms:** `{account_sid, secret (Twilio auth token), from, to}`, one Twilio API request per recipient in `to`.
  - All three: three attempts with 1s and 2s backoff on retryable failures (network errors and `5xx`/`429` for webhook/sms; `4xx` for email, per SMTP's convention above); non-retryable failures fail at once.
- **Channels** are admin-managed. Secrets are encrypted at rest (AES-GCM, key derived from `ARGUS_JWT_SECRET`, so **changing the JWT secret invalidates stored channel secrets**). The API never returns a plaintext secret: webhook shows only the URL's host and `has_secret`; email shows the SMTP host/from/to; sms shows from/to and the account SID masked after its first 4 characters.
- **API** (`/api/v1`): viewers read `/alert-rules`, `/alert-events`; editors write `/alert-rules` and list `/channels`; admins write `/channels` and call `POST /channels/{id}/test`.
- **In the app:** an **Alerts** tab (rules with state badges, last value, enable/disable, editor, history) and a *Notification channels* card in **Settings** for admins. The app's channel editor UI has not been updated for the `email`/`sms` fields yet; use the API directly for those until it has.

Limitations: Slack and push notifications are still Phase 10 stretch goals. Rule evaluation uses the shared `ruler` query user, so it counts against that user's concurrency limit. The ruler runs inside the server process; run one server per data directory.

## Performance and hardening (Phase 8)

### Faster line filters: chunk bloom filters
Each block of a chunk now carries a bloom filter over its 3-byte windows (trigrams). A `|= "text"` filter of **3 or more bytes** checks the filter and skips every block that cannot contain the text, without decompressing it. Regex (`|~`), negated (`!=`, `!~`) and shorter filters scan as before, and blocks are never skipped wrongly (a bloom has false positives, not false negatives).
- Chunk format is now **version 2**. Version 1 chunks still read (they just cannot skip blocks), so no migration is needed and old data keeps working.
- **Downgrading** to a binary from before this phase cannot read chunks written after the upgrade.
- Cost: about 6 bits per distinct trigram, capped at 32 KiB per block (measured on two synthetic shapes: +20% for very repetitive logfmt lines, which compress best, and +8% for varied JSON lines; your data will differ). A test with a rare filter over 6,000 lines scanned under a quarter of them with identical results.
- Metric queries (`count_over_time({...} |= "x" [5m])`) use the same filters.

### Query tuning
- `ARGUS_QUERY_WORKERS` sets the parallel chunk scanners per query (default: number of CPUs). Lower it on a shared host; raise it only if scans are I/O bound.
- Metric results are cached for one step (Phase 6). Log queries are not cached: dashboard and Explore requests carry a new `start`/`end` each time, so a cache would almost never hit. The scan limits from Phase 3 (`ARGUS_QUERY_*`) still apply.

### PII redaction and sampling at ingest
Both run before the WAL write, so redacted text never touches disk. They are off unless set.
- `ARGUS_REDACT`: comma list of `email`, `bearer`, `card`, `ip`, or `all`. Matches become `[REDACTED:<rule>]`. Patterns are heuristic (the card rule matches any 13-19 digit run, so it can redact long IDs). Stored data is not rewritten when you change the setting.
- `ARGUS_SAMPLE`: `service=percent` pairs, e.g. `api=25,worker=10,*=50` keeps that percent of lines. Lines at **warn or above are always kept**, as are services with no rule and no `*`. Level comes from the `level` label, else a JSON `"level"`/`"severity"` field, else logfmt `level=`; a line with no detectable level counts as not important and is sampled. Dropped lines are reported as `sampled` in the push response, do not count against rate limits, and are not recoverable.

### Operations
- **`GET /readyz`** (no auth, 200 or 503) checks the database. `GET /healthz` stays a plain liveness check.
- **`GET /metrics`** (Prometheus text) needs an admin session, or `Authorization: Bearer $ARGUS_METRICS_TOKEN` if that variable is set. Without either it answers 401. Metrics: ingest lines/bytes/rejected/sampled/rate-limited, chunks flushed and flush duration and errors, query duration and errors by kind (`log`, `metric`; alert evaluation is not counted), head lines (unflushed), WAL segments and bytes, open live tails, data directory size (cached 30s), uptime, goroutines, heap.
- **Login lockout:** 5 failed sign-ins for one email lock it for 30s, doubling per further failure up to 15 minutes; 20 failures from one IP lock that IP the same way. A locked email is refused even with the right password (HTTP 429 with `Retry-After`). Counters decay after 15 quiet minutes, live in memory (a restart clears them) and use the TCP peer address, not `X-Forwarded-For`, so behind a reverse proxy all clients share one IP key and the per-email limit does the work.
- **TLS:** set `ARGUS_TLS_CERT` and `ARGUS_TLS_KEY` (both or neither) to serve HTTPS directly.
- **Graceful shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM):** live tails are told to reconnect, in-flight pushes drain (up to 15s), background loops stop, then head chunks are flushed and the WAL closed.

### Backup and restore
`argus backup <dir>` copies a **running** server's data (SQLite only; use `pg_dump` for Postgres). It writes `<dir>/wal`, `<dir>/argus.db` (a consistent `VACUUM INTO` snapshot) and `<dir>/chunks`, in that order, which can duplicate a line on restore but cannot lose one. Chunks are immutable, so running it again to the same directory copies only new chunks. It checks the snapshot (`integrity_check`) and reports indexed chunks missing from the copy (usually removed by retention in the meantime; not an error).
```
ARGUS_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/argus argus backup /backups/argus
```
Restore: stop the server, move the old data directory aside, then copy the backup's contents back and start:
```
mv /var/lib/argus /var/lib/argus.old && mkdir /var/lib/argus
cp -r /backups/argus/. /var/lib/argus/
argus
```
On start the server replays the WAL copy. Lines that were already flushed when the backup ran appear twice (replay is at-least-once). The destination must be outside the data directory. Channel secrets are encrypted with a key derived from `ARGUS_JWT_SECRET`, so restore with the same secret or re-enter them.

### Soak test
`ARGUS_SOAK_SECONDS=300 ARGUS_SOAK_RATE=2000 go test ./internal/ingest -run TestSoak -timeout 30m -v` alternates 5 seconds at the base rate with 5 seconds at 5x while a log query runs every 250ms and a metric query every second, then checks no line was lost, the slowest push stayed under 5s, queries had no errors, goroutines did not grow and live heap stayed flat (set `ARGUS_SOAK_HEAPPROFILE=<file>` to keep a heap profile for `go tool pprof`). Results on a development laptop (in-process, no network):

| Run | Lines sent / stored | Push p99 / max | Heap, 2nd quarter to last quarter |
|---|---|---|---|
| 60s, base 2,000/s, burst 10,000/s (before fix) | 360,000 / 360,000 | n/a | 182 MB to 311 MB (failed) |
| 60s, same load (after fix) | 360,000 / 360,000 | 17 ms / 103 ms | 17 MB to 25 MB |
| 180s, same load (after fix) | 1,080,000 / 1,080,000 | 17 ms / 82 ms | 23 MB to 24 MB |

The first run found a real problem: the zstd encoder's default 8 MiB window was pinned by every concurrent encoder, holding about 250 MB. Shrinking the window to 1 MiB (blocks are about 256 KiB) removed it with no format change. Limits of this evidence: the longest run is 3 minutes, not hours; the load is in-process through the HTTP handler, so network and TLS are not exercised; retention and alert evaluation were not running.

## Services and the agent

The **Services** tab lists every value of the `service` label that has shipped logs, with an active dot, last-seen time and stored volume. Nothing is registered: a service appears the first time something ships a line with that label. Click one to watch its live stream, or switch to **History** to query older lines (pick a time range, filter by text, or start the filter with `|` for a pipeline such as `| json | level="error"`).

`GET /api/v1/services` backs the list (optional `start`, `end`, and `label` to use a label other than `service`). Volume counts flushed chunks only, so it can lag the newest lines slightly.

To get systemd units and Kubernetes pods in without configuring each one, run [`agent/`](agent/README.md) on the host or node. SDKs and Loki clients (Alloy, Promtail) work too, as long as they set a `service` label.

## Client SDKs and Loki-compatible push (Phase 9)

### SDKs
Two small libraries ship an application's logs to Argus. Both are built so they cannot hurt the app: logging never blocks or throws, memory is bounded by a fixed-size queue, a full queue drops lines (and counts them), and failed sends are retried with backoff and then dropped. Details and options are in each README.

| **Go** | [`sdk/go`](sdk/go/README.md) (own module `github.com/cragone/Super-Argus/sdk/go`, standard library only) | a `log/slog` handler plus a raw `Send`; the testapp now uses it |
| **Node/TypeScript** | [`sdk/node`](sdk/node/README.md) (`argus-logger`, no runtime dependencies, Node 18+) | `log.info('msg', {fields})`, `close()` to flush on exit; not published to npm yet |

Delivery is at-least-once, and lines still queued when a process dies are lost.

### Loki-compatible push
`POST /api/v1/ingest/loki` (also at `/loki/api/v1/push`, the path Loki clients default to) accepts the Loki push API, so Promtail, Grafana Alloy, Fluent Bit or Vector can point at Argus unchanged. Both wire formats work: JSON (`{"streams":[{"stream":{...},"values":[["<unix ns>","line"]]}]}`) and snappy-compressed protobuf (`Content-Type: application/x-protobuf`, the Promtail/Alloy default). Gzip request bodies are accepted.
- **Auth:** the Argus API key as `X-Argus-Key`, as a bearer token, or as the password (or username) of HTTP basic auth.
- **Same pipeline as the native push:** per-key rate limits, stream limits, redaction and sampling, label rules and the age limits all apply. Success is `204`; a request where every line was refused is `400`.
- **Labels:** names Loki would normalise (dots, dashes) are rewritten with underscores, so `app.name` is queried as `app_name`. Loki *structured metadata* is ignored.
- **Not verified against real shippers.** It is tested with hand-built JSON and protobuf+snappy bodies matching Loki's wire format, not with a running Promtail, Alloy, Fluent Bit or Vector. Try yours against a non-production Argus first.

### Does Argus going down affect an app? (`sdk/e2e/run.mjs`)
`node sdk/e2e/run.mjs go` (or `node`) builds and starts the real server, runs a sample app that logs about 2,000 lines/s through the SDK, **hard-kills the server** 6 seconds in, leaves it down for 10 seconds, restarts it on the same data (WAL recovery), then compares what the app logged with what Argus stored. A run on a development laptop (Windows, everything on one machine, 28 seconds):

| | Go SDK | Node SDK |
|---|---|---|
| Worst single log call, Argus up / **down** / recovered | 0.77 / **2.06** / 0.77 ms | 2.03 / **1.09** / 1.15 ms |
| Lines the app logged | 56,000 | 34,460 |
| Acknowledged by Argus | 45,381 | 31,400 |
| Dropped by the SDK (queue full or retries exhausted) | 10,619 | 3,060 |
| Stored in Argus after the restart | 45,381 | 31,400 |

Every logged line is accounted for (sent plus dropped equals logged), logs flow again after the restart, and everything Argus acknowledged was still there after the crash. The script exits non-zero if any log call takes over 100 ms. The two SDKs differ in volume only because the Node sample's 10 ms timer fires about every 15 ms on Windows. Limits of this evidence: one machine, a single 10-second outage, a process kill rather than a power loss, and the sample apps are stand-ins rather than production services.
